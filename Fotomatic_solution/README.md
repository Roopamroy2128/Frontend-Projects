## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the core HTML structure for the webpage.

### 2. **Sign-Up Section**

   - **Call-to-Action Button**: The "Join the waiting list" button is designed to be prominent and accessible on mobile devices.

### 3. **Responsive Layout for Content Sections**
   - **Features Section**: Content in this section is arranged to adjust gracefully, allowing images and text to stack on smaller screens for better readability.
   - **Filters Section**: The grid of filter images adjusts to fit screen size, ensuring that each image is visible without excessive scrolling.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- **HTML**: Provides the foundational structure for the page content.
- **CSS**: Styles the content, with a focus on responsive design techniques.
- **Media Queries**: Used extensively in `style.css` to adjust layouts, font sizes, and image placements based on device screen width.
- **Flexbox and Grid Layouts**: Employed for flexible, responsive layouts, ensuring smooth scaling of elements.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

2. **Open the Webpage**: Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the Fotomatic site.

3. **Inspect Responsiveness**: Test the webpageâ€™s responsiveness by resizing your browser window or by using browser developer tools to simulate various screen sizes and devices.

## Development Guide

1. **Responsive Breakpoints**
The following breakpoints are defined to ensure the layout adapts seamlessly across devices:

- **Large Screens**: 1024px and above for desktops.
- **Tablets**: 768px to 1024px.
- **Mobile Devices**: Below 768px for smartphones.

2. **Flexible Image Sizing**
Images are scaled relative to their container sizes to prevent overflow on smaller screens, maintaining a balanced and visually appealing layout.

3. **Font Adjustments**
Font sizes and styles are adapted based on screen width to ensure readability across devices. Larger screens display fonts at a standard size, while smaller screens use optimized font scaling for easy reading on mobile and tablet devices.

4. **Media Query Example**
- **1. Adjusting Font Sizes and Padding for Smaller Screens**:
This media query reduces the font size of headings and adjusts padding to improve readability and spacing on smaller screens.
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 1.5em;
  }
  .content {
    padding: 10px;
  }
}
```
- **2. Reflowing Layout Elements for Narrow Screens**:
To optimize the layout on narrow screens, this media query reflows specific elements for a more user-friendly experience. The `.feature` sections are stacked vertically, making content easier to read and navigate on smaller devices. Additionally, the `.images-container` is adjusted to display two columns, providing a balanced grid layout.
```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .feature {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
  .images-container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  }
}
```
